## teacher-library

An extremely basic check-in/checkout system to track books and students.

Allows teachers to enter students, books, and allow them to checkout and check-in books at any time.  It will keep track of what is checked out, and by whom, so teachers can watch their books.

Built in django, on Python 3.6.
